		<h2>Logic and Programming</h2>
		<p>Logic and problem-solving are two of the most vital and fundamental skills needed in order to become an IT professional. Programmers use logic to take large problems and break them down into smaller parts before writing any code. Once a plan is created, programmers then translate that plan into code and write programs that are both efficient and effective in solving the problem. For these reasons, it is extremly important for any programmer to develop an understanding of both logic and the basic fundamentals of writing programs.</p>

		<h2>Web Development</h2>
		<!-- <p>I'm still writing the Web Dev paragraph :( I'm sorry it's taking so long</p> -->
		<p>Most websites in the world, including this one, are created using special programming languages called <em>markup languages</em>, such as HTML5 and XML. These markup languages are used to write various tags and elements containing the content of webpages, which are often formatted afterwards using a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). In a world of E-commerce and online content creation, it is essential for anyone in the IT industry to be comfortable working with and creating websites and web-based applications. </p>
